## Set LESS CSS-PreCompiler as Default

Install less & less-loader via npm then change your styleExt in angular-cli.json to either less (or you can set that via ng set defaults.styleExt less)
Then change src/style.css to src/style.less and ['app.component.css'] to ['app.component.less']. It will work as expected.
